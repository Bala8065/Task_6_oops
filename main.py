#1. Problem 1 : Bank account 
#Create a base class bank account with attributes like account number, balance, and methods like deposit()a and withdraw(). Inherit from this class to create subclasses saving account and current account. The saving account should have an interest rate and a method to calculate interest. The current account should have a minimum balance requirement. Implement encapsulation to protect the account balance and ensure that withdrawals cannot exceed the balance or minimum balance requirements. 


# Python program to create Bankaccount class


# with both a deposit() and a withdraw() function
